The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. 
The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia.
New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.
